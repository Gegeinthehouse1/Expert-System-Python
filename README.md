**Weather Expert System**

**Introduction**
The Weather Expert System is a simple expert system designed to assess the current weather condition based on the user's input temperature. It uses predefined rules to classify the weather as either "hot," "freezing," or "moderate." This system makes use of logical conditions to evaluate a numerical input (temperature) and provide an appropriate response based on the given conditions. The system is built using object-oriented programming principles, where rules and reasoning are encapsulated in an expert system class.

This expert system can be extended and customized to handle additional weather-related rules or features, such as assessing humidity or wind speed.

_Features_
User Input: The user is prompted to enter the current temperature.
Rules Engine: The system evaluates the temperature against several predefined rules to classify the weather.
Output: Based on the temperature input, the system will classify the weather as either "hot," "freezing," or "moderate."
Rules
The system uses three rules for classification:

Hot Day: If the temperature is above 30째C, the system will classify the weather as "hot."
Freezing Day: If the temperature is below 0째C, the system will classify the weather as "freezing."
Moderate Day: If the temperature is between 0째C and 30째C, the system will classify the weather as "moderate."
Code Description
The WeatherExpertSystem class extends the ExpertSystem class, which provides the core functionality of adding and evaluating rules. The rules method defines three rules using lambda functions and conditions. These rules are then evaluated against the user input to provide the weather classification.

The user is prompted to enter the temperature, and based on the input, the appropriate rule is triggered. The system then returns a message indicating whether the weather is "hot," "freezing," or "moderate."

Commit Changes Method (Optional Extended Description)
To enhance the system's functionality, we have introduced an optional commit_changes method, which allows for uploading or committing any changes to the system. This method can be used to update the rules or add new ones dynamically, with an optional extended description of the changes. This feature is especially useful when integrating new data sources or rules into the system.

Example Commit Changes Method:
python
Copy code
def commit_changes(self, changes, description=None):
    """
    Method to commit changes to the expert system, such as adding new rules.
    
    Parameters:
    - changes (dict): A dictionary of changes to be committed.
    - description (str, optional): A detailed description of the changes being committed.
    
    If a description is provided, it will be printed out as part of the commit process.
    """
    # Commit the changes
    for rule_condition, rule_description in changes.items():
        self.add_rule(rule_condition, rule_description)
    
    if description:
        print(f"Changes committed: {description}")
    else:
        print("Changes committed successfully.")
This method takes a dictionary of changes (such as new or modified rules) and an optional description of the changes. If a description is provided, it will be printed to give the user more context on the updates made.
**
How to Use**
Run the system: To run the system, you need to create an instance of the WeatherExpertSystem class, define your rules, and run the evaluation based on the input temperature.

Commit Changes: Use the commit_changes method to add or modify rules. This allows for easy system updates with an optional description of the changes.

**Sample Run**
python
Copy code
# Create an instance of the weather expert system
weather_system = WeatherExpertSystem()

# Ask for user input and evaluate the weather
temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature: "))
result = weather_system.run(temperature)
print(result)
Example Output:
less
Copy code
Enter the current temperature: 25
It's a moderate day.
Conclusion
This simple expert system demonstrates the power of logical reasoning in making decisions based on a set of predefined rules. It can easily be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as integrating other weather parameters or handling dynamic rule updates via the commit_changes method.
